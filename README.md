### Hello! Nice to meet you ğŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer that's worn many hats over years.

I've done product management, backend, frontend, data science, human-computer interactions research, and more.

My heart-of-hearts lies in startups, and I bring that spirit wherever I go to get things done (even at the biggest companies).
